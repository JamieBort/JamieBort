## things I like

**Things I've noticed in other people's profile readme files that I want to emulate.**

I like to read on someone's profile readme that they welcome questions, people reaching out to them, etc.
Do the same on mine.

> I love connecting with different people so if you want to say hi, I'll be happy to meet you more! :)

## features to add

A `Current Projects` section.

A statement welcoming people to reach out to me, ask questions, etc.

## things to change/improve

### description

I've noticed that I don't have the description filled in. Should I have one?

See the below "about" image:

See this "If you are forking please do not forget to star the repo" fork suggestion:
